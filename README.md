This is the front end design for Institute Advancement (IA) Website, including giving.rpi.edu (live in early September), alumni.rpi.edu (pending), parents.rpi.edu (pending). These are intended for people working with IA to build and improve web infrastructure. While we are in the build phase, please do not widely publicize the designs.

Rensselaer students, alumni/ae, constituents, and community members are invited to contribute to the design by creating Issues and Pull Requests.

The HTML files are page type variations. There are a couple of different page types and branding types. You can view an index at http://homepages.rpi.edu/~chamem/index.html.

There is a pattern library at giving.rpi.edu/patterns.

The CSS is built using SASS. There are separate variations for Alumni, Giving iModules, and Giving Drupal. And each one of those has a separate IE8 version.
