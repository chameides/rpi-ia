This is the front end design for Institute Advancement (IA) Website. The HTML files are page type variations. There are a couple of different page types and branding types. You can view an index at http://homepages.rpi.edu/~chamem/index.html. There is a live pattern library at http://giving.rpi.edu/patterns.

The CSS is built using SASS. There are separate variations for Alumni, Giving iModules, and Giving Drupal. And each one of those has a separate IE8 version.

See internal documentation for more details.
