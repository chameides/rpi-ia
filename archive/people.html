              <h1>Empower Our People</h1>  
            </div>
            <p>Rensselaer students work alongside world-class faculty to seek answers to today&lsquo;s most pressing global challenges. Gifts toward scholarships, fellowships, and faculty support help us attract and retain the brightest students and professors.</p>
            <h2>Students</h2>
            <p>At Rensselaer, our students are the future leaders who will leave their mark on the world. To solve the global challenges and achieve greater global impact, we must attract and retain the most talented students from all corners of the globe, regardless of their financial status.</p>
            <p>Scholarship aid affords us the means to reach deep into a talent pool that spans the nation, crosses economic and cultural barriers, and represents the best and the brightest hope for the future.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>At Rensselaer, more than 90 percent of our students receive some kind of financial aid.</li>
              <li>Yet we are only able to meet 75% of students&rsquo; financial need.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because of this financial aid need gap, we run the risk of losing talented students to other schools that can provide a more comprehensive financial aid package.</p>
            <p>Gifts to support scholarships help us close this gap and make a difference in the lives of our students.</p>  
            <p>You can support a student through the <a href="">Rensselaer Annual Fund</a> or through the <a href="">Rensselaer Endowment</a>.</p>
            <p><a href="">Make your gift now</a> or <a href="">contact us</a> now to support Rensselaer students.</p>
            <h2>Scholarship Support &ndash; Annual Fund</h2>
            <p>When you support a Rensselaer student through the Annual Fund, you are making a gift from one generation to the next. Gifts to the Annual Fund support many aspects that directly impact Rensselaer students, from scholarships, athletics, teaching, research, mobile computing, interactive classrooms, student life programs, and many more.</p>
            <p><a href="">Make your gift to the Annual Fund now </a> or <a href="">contact us</a> directly to learn more about how you can support the Rensselaer Annual Fund.</p>
            <h2>Patroon Scholars Program of the Annual Fund</h2>
            <p>The power to make a difference in the lives of our students is fully realized through the <a href="">Patroon Scholars Program</a>. With a gift of $10,000 per year for four years (or five is the student is in the School of Architecture), you can change lives by easing the financial burden for a student. Your gift will sponsor an individual student, or students, selected by the Office of Financial Aid during their term of study at Rensselaer.</p>
            <p>Participants in these programs are encouraged to meet their students throughout the year, particularly at the annual <a href="">Celebration of Support</a>, and many have developed lasting relationships over the years. In addition to providing counsel to students, Patroon Scholar donors help to instill a culture of philanthropy at Rensselaer and inspire the next generation to give.</p>
            <p>To learn more about this program, download the <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/giving/print/Patroon Scholars Brochure.pdf">Patroon Scholars Brochure</a> or email <a href="mailto:codner@rpi.edu">Becky Codner</a> or call her at <a class="phone" href="tel:518-276-3088">(518) 276-3088</a>.</p>

I also saved a power point here that may contain some good student quotes that we can use.</a></small>
            <h2>Scholarship Support &ndash; Endowment</h2>
            <p>Building scholarship support within our endowment helps attract the very best students and ensures that they are able to attend, regardless of their ability to pay full tuition.</p> 
            <p>Financial support for graduate students is equally critical to the success of the entire academic enterprise. Two-thirds of our graduate students receive financial support from fellowships, teaching assistantships, and research assistantships. To build our graduate programs in both size and quality will require greatly increased resources in financial aid for graduate students.</p>
            <p>More than 90 percent of our students receive some sort of financial aid. Yet our endowed scholarship resources leave us well behind competing institutions.</p>
            <p>An endowed scholarship (unrestricted) may be established for a minimum gift of $200,000, and a restricted scholarship fund may be established for $250,000, to ensure a student's future promise.</p> 
            <p>Your support of a student is truly appreciated and you are afforded opportunities to interact with your student throughout the year, particularly at the annual <a href="">Celebration of Support</a>.</p>

These two video clips below were done by SCER, but might be nice to feature as examples of the kinds of students we have here and the ability to support the pivotal, world changing work they are doing:

I think this is also a good opportunity to insert student quotes, and I have compiled a listing of possible ones to feature in this document and also pulled them from the Patroon Brunch power point. </small>
            <h2>Faculty</h2>
            <p>Faculty &ndash; excellent faculty &ndash; are at the core of what we do at Rensselaer. Growing our faculty is an explicit goal of <em>The Rensselaer Plan 2024</em>, and one that will require steadfast commitment in light of increasing competition around the world. Recruitment, retention, and renewal of faculty are critical to achieve our goal of expanding our tenured and tenured track positions to 500.<p>
            <p>World-class faculty attract world-class students, as well as major sources of research funding. This powerful combination is the key to realizing our goals. The success of <em>The Rensselaer Plan 2024</em> &ndash; indeed the future of Rensselaer &ndash; relies on building a well-funded research enterprise.</p>
            <p>You can support faculty through the <a href="">Rensselaer Annual Fund</a> or through the <a href="">Rensselaer Endowment</a>.</p>
            <p><a href="">Make your gift now</a> or <a href="">contact us</a> now to support Rensselaer students.</p>
            <h2>Faculty Support &ndash; Rensselaer Annual Fund</h2>
            <p>Support for faculty strengthens Rensselaer at its core. Gifts to the Annual Fund enable Rensselaer faculty to pursue individual research initiatives, or recruit additional graduate students to support their work, as well as enable both faculty and students access to conferences, travel, and other development opportunities that will enrich their Rensselaer experience.</p>
            <p><a href="">Make your gift to the Annual Fund now</a> or <a href="">contact us</a> directly to learn more about how you can support faculty through the Rensselaer Annual Fund.</p> 
            <h2>Faculty Support &ndash; Rensselaer Endowment</h2>
            <p>Endowment for faculty is critical at all levels, in every school, and in each department &ndash; for the bright junior faculty member just making a mark in education and building exciting new research programs, to the more senior professors and internationally-renowned scholars working at the frontiers of research questing after new knowledge. Endowments are also critical in enabling the teacher-scholar whose dedication to innovation in the classroom ensures that fresh ideas are infused in the curriculum, and that new and exciting ways of delivering education enrich the students’ experience at Rensselaer.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Named professorships &ndash; in particular, fully endowed chairs</strong> &ndash; are the most effective means of ensuring that top scholars come to Rensselaer and stay here. A named professorship honors the faculty member who holds it, the donor who funded it, and the institution that brought them together. It provides the essential financial resources for creative research and innovative teaching, and it distinguishes the holder as a leader among peers, both on campus and in the broader academy. (Note: We should link to press releases where we are talking about named chairs here, http://news.rpi.edu/content/2013/12/10/natural-language-processing-expert-heng-ji-joins-rensselaer-edward-p-hamilton#, http://news.rpi.edu/content/2013/11/04/ganpati-ramanath-named-john-tod-horton-%E2%80%9952-professor-materials-engineering, http://news.rpi.edu/content/2013/10/23/stacy-patterson-joins-rensselaer-clare-boothe-luce-assistant-professor, etc.) We could also link to the David Jepson Making a Difference column, talking about his gift in support of faculty.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Faculty Constellations</strong> are multidisciplinary teams of senior faculty, early career faculty, and graduate and undergraduate students. The constellation faculty features three or more outstanding stars in a particular research field. These research fields build upon existing core strengths in microelectronics and microsystems, advanced materials, nanotechnology, and advanced scientific computation, modeling and simulation. A constellation goes well beyond an investment in a single world-class faculty member. Taken together, the constellations are a critical mass of outstanding faculty, who, in partnership with existing Rensselaer stars, will transform the Institute and lead it to its rightful place as an international leader among research universities. Learn more about specific faculty constellations here, <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/research/constellations.html">http://www.rpi.edu/research/constellations.html.</a></li>

            <blockquote>I’m the Howard P. Isermann &rsquo;42 Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering, and I actually know Howard Isermann. Quite frankly, it was one of the major reasons why I came here. I met Howard prior to accepting the position here at Rensselaer, and I saw in him a true love for the institution, a desire to see the institution become even greater than it is, and that he was putting his money where his thoughts are and where his dreams were.</blockquote>
            <cite>Jonathan Dordick, Vice President for Research, Howard P. Isermann &rsquo;42 Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering</cite> 
            <blockquote>We all need benefactors like John Broadbent and his family to build. And it’s an investment for them in the future but it’s also an investment in us and we feel that necessity to really perform at the top of our game, at the top of our act in order to deserve the funding that we get from people like John Broadbent and the other donors.</blockquote>
            <cite>Robert J. Linhardt, Ann and John H. Broadbent, Jr. &rsquo;59 Senior Constellation Professor in Biocatalysis and Metabolic Engineering
            </cite>
            <blockquote>Endowment is the highest honor a faculty can receive. And certainly I’m very humbled and honored to have that recognition from the Institute. But at the same time it’s kind of a responsibility. And again, I’m very grateful for Institute, I’m very grateful to the Iovino’s for making that possible.</blockquote>
            <cite>Tarek Hassan Abdoun, Ph.D. &rsquo;94 Judith and Thomas Iovino &rsquo;73 Career Development Professor in Civil Engineering</cite>
